## Line Breaks

Line Breaks work if you put "  " ( two spaces) and a return in the part of the sentence you want to "break" into a new line.

## Emails and Links

```
use <> to create a clickable link

ex-
<jamminjam@gmail.com>

You can also write out alternative words for the link to show:
[Alternative text](link)

ex-

[Macdown Website](link to macdown website)
```

## Reference Style

you can reference tags in markdown and give those references  a link somewhere else on the md document to keep the doc looking clean.  

``` 
[Alt text](link ID)

and then on a line somewhere else:
[link ID]: link url

```

## Images

` [Alt Image Text](path/or/url.to.jpg "optional text")`

`![Alt Image Text][image-id]`. 

on it's own line elsewhere:  

`[image-id]: path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title"`


## Lists

```

* lists must be preceded by a blank line. 
* unordered lists start each item with a *
- - works too
	- here is how you make a nested list
		- you need to indent to give levels to your lists.
		- numbering your list will also make the list ordered.
			1. see
			2. here
			3. and
			4. again
```

## inline code

to print out code in markdown, you need to use ` ` ( one back tick ` in the front and another at the end ).

`ex: here `

you can also indent 4 spaces to create a code block

				ex: here is the code
				
## horizontal rules

if you type three asterisks or three dashes ` *** or --- ` in a line, it'll display a horizontal rule

ex-
***
and
